## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs a natural-language location query.  
2. On the backend, an AI interpretive layer extracts intent and location context.  
3. The API layer queries mapping services (e.g., Geocoding, Places).  
4. Results are structured and delivered back to the frontend for display.
